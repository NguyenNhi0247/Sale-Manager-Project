      <a href="https://www.betterworldbooks.com/go/privacy"
        target="_blank">https://www.betterworldbooks.com/go/privacy</a>
      ), we use cookies and other technologies to ensure everyone who uses our

    <p>
      <strong>2.</strong>
      <strong>WHAT IS A COOKIE?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      A cookie is a small file placed onto your device from our servers. They are
      widely used in order to make websites and cloud-based services work in a
      better, more efficient way. For example, they can recognize you and
      remember important information that will make your use of a website or
      cloud-based service more convenient (e.g., by allowing you to enter a
      password less frequently or remembering your user preferences).
    </p>
    <p>
      Taken alone, cookies do not personally identify you – rather, they merely
      recognize your Web browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to
      Better World Books, such as filling out a web form or you have previously
      identified yourself to us, you remain anonymous.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>3. </strong>
      <strong>WHAT COOKIES DO WE USE?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      We use different types of cookies on our Sites to make your interaction
      with our Sites easy and meaningful – strictly necessary cookies,
      functionality cookies, analytics cookies, and analytic cookies used for
      re-marketing, and advertising. The Sites may include first-party cookies
      (i.e., cookies that send data directly to Better World Books and agents and
      contractors acting on our behalf , including cookies used to monitor,
      analyze, and administer the Sites) and third-party cookies (i.e., cookies
      that send data to our contractors for their commercial use).
    </p>
    <p>
      We use cookies that are session-based and persistent-based. Session cookies
      exist only during one session. They disappear from your computer or device
      when you close your browser software or turn off your computer. Persistent
      cookies remain on your computer or device after you close your browser or
      turn off your computer. You can control the use of cookies at the
      individual browser level (see Section 5 below for instructions on how to do
      so), but note that if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use
      of certain features or functions on our services and websites.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below we describe the different types of cookies we may use on the Sites
      and our purpose for using them. You have the ability to opt out and limit
      which cookies apply to your use of our Sites – more information on how to
      change your browser’s cookie settings are provided in Section 5 below.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>A. </strong>
      <strong>Strictly Necessary Cookies.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Some cookies are essential to the operation of our services on the Sites.
      They are used to facilitate our log-in process, authenticate users, and
      enable you to navigate the Sites and to use their features. They are also
      used by our customer service team for in product messaging and analytics.
      Without these cookies, we may not be able to provide certain services or
      features, and the Sites may not perform as smoothly for you as we would
      like.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because strictly necessary cookies are essential to operate our services on
      the Sites, if you choose to use a product on our Sites, there is no option
      to opt out of these cookies.<strong></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>B. </strong>
      <strong>Functionality Cookies.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      In some circumstances, we may use functionality cookies. Functionality
      cookies allow us to remember the choices you make while browsing on the
      Sites, and to provide enhanced and more personalized content and features,
      such as customizing a certain webpage or application page, remembering if
      we have asked you to participate in a promotion and for other services you
      request, like watching a video or commenting on a blog. In order to permit
      your connection to the Sites, our servers receive and record information
      about your computer and browser, potentially including your IP address,
      browser type, and other software or hardware information. All of these
      features help us to improve your visit and assist in navigation of the
      Sites’ features.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>C. </strong>
      <strong>Analytics Cookies.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      We and our service providers may use analytics cookies, which are sometimes
      called performance cookies, to collect information about your use of the
      Sites and enable us to improve the way they work. Analytics cookies collect
      information about how you use the Sites, for instance, which pages you go
      to most. The information allows us to see the overall patterns of usage,
      help us record any difficulties users may have while using the Sites and
      show us whether or not our advertising is effective.
    </p>
    <p>
      To manage the use of analytics cookies on our Sites, or to opt out of their
      use, follow the instructions in Section 5 of this Cookie Policy. Note that
      opting out may impact the functionality you receive when using our Sites.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>D. </strong>
      <strong>Advertising Cookies.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      We may also use cookies and similar tools to correlate your use of the
      Sites to personal information obtained about you. For example, if you have
      asked us to provide you information about our upcoming campaigns, our
      services or any promotions, we may utilize our cookie and/or clickstream
      data about your activities when you engage with us on the Sites. By
      evaluating this information, we may more clearly target the information we
      provide you to the specific items we think you will find interesting, based
      on your prior online activities and preferences.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also use third party advertising cookies. We and our service providers
      may use advertising cookies to deliver ads that we believe are more
      relevant to you and your interests.
    </p>
    <p>
      To manage the use of advertising cookies on our Sites, or to opt out of
      their use, follow the instructions in Section 5 of this Cookie Policy. Note
      that opting out may impact the functionality you receive when using our
      Sites.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>4. </strong>
      <strong>THIRD PARTY COOKIES ON THE SITES.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      In some circumstances, we may work with third parties to provide services
      on our Sites. For example, we use analytics services supported by third
      party companies who generate analytics cookies on our behalf. We may not
      have access to these cookies, although we may use statistical information
      arising from the cookies provided by these third parties to customize
      content and for the other purposes described above. These companies may
      also transfer this information to other parties where required to do so by
      law, or where such other parties process the information on their behalf.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may not control these third-party cookies and their use may be governed
      by the privacy policies of the third parties employing these cookies. To
      learn about these cookies and to disable or reject third-party cookies,
      please refer to the relevant third party’s website and privacy policy.

      <strong>5. </strong>
      <strong>HOW YOU CAN CONTROL COOKIES ON OUR SITES.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to control the cookies that are placed on your computer or
      other device, you could view cookies stored on your hard drive, choose
      whether or not to permit cookies to be set by default by changing browser
      settings as provided in this Section, or delete the cookies stored on your
      hard drive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please be aware, however, that your decision to control cookies may affect
      your experience of our Sites – you may not be able to access all or parts
      of those Sites. Turning cookies off, for instance, will prevent you from
      registering for, signing in to, and using many of the services on our
      Sites.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main Web browsers allow you to change your cookie settings directly
      through their sites. These settings will typically be found in the
      ‘options’ or ‘preferences’ menu of your browser. In order to understand
      these settings, the following links may be helpful; otherwise you should

      <strong>“DO NOT TRACK” SIGNALS.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do Not Track” is a concept that has been promoted by regulatory agencies
      such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), for the Internet industry
      to develop and implement a mechanism for allowing Internet users to control
      the tracking of their online activities across websites by using browser
      settings. Some Web browsers may be configured to send Do Not Track signals
      to websites, or users may use similar mechanisms, to indicate a user’s
      preference that certain web technologies not be used to track the user’s
      online activity. The Sites do not accept or process such Do Not Track
      signals or similar mechanisms.
